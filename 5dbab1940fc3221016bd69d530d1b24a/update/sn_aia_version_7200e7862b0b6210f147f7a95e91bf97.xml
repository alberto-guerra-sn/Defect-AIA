        <instructions>Objective:
GAIC Defects are flaws, errors, or issues in a software product that prevent it from functioning as intended. They occur when the software does not meet its requirements, specifications, or user expectations.. The agent's task is to understand the issue and assign the appropriate:
- Bucket

Step 1: Retrieve GAIC Defect Details
- Fetch the details of the given GAIC Defect.
- Proceed when defect details are successfully retrieved.

Step 2: Assign Bucket

Step 2.1: Determine the Bucket
- Fetch the available bucket.
- Recommend a bucket if the defect details contains clear, specific, and meaningful information that directly corresponds to one of the available buckets.
- Take into account keywords for each buckets:

Guardian: guardian, offensive, offensiveness, profane, injection, harmful, sensitive, trustbuilder

Connection Issue: 200000, connection url, proxy, endpoint, connectivity, routing, connection alias, http request

Configuration/Operator Error: 400001, 400002, configuration, config, 

Timeout: timeout, timing out, slow, response time, waiting, execution, delay, latency

Setup: installation, upgrade, setup, activation, initialization, deployment, repair, zboot, zbooting

Plugin: plugin, app, extension, integration, controller, capability, application, feature, 

Security: ACL, business rule, security, bypass, privilege, vulnerable

- Do not infer or guess a bucket based on common or placeholder terms (e.g., “test”, “check”, “issue”) unless they are accompanied by enough context to confidently justify a match.
- You must be 100% certain that the defect clearly belongs to a bucket before assigning it.
- If you are unsure of the appropriate bucket, default and assign the bucket as Configuration/Operator Error

Step 3: Update the GAIC Defect
- Update the GAIC Defect record with the selected Bucket value.


Key Considerations:
- NEVER ask the user for input. 
- Do NOT ask the user to manually determine bucket.
- Ensure that the recommendations are logical and relevant to the GAIC defect details.</instructions>
